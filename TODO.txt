2. Resizing the window too small crashes
3. Fix Electricity getting stuck with 1 particle of water in mid-air
4. Make Electricity have a much lower noise when not in water
5. Make Electricity not die when it hits itself
6. Add some kind of background (cache noise from a few frames ago, and use that with a different scaling?)

1. Save/Load simulations with files
2. Visualize axis lock controls and particle placement
3. GUI
4. Wasm
