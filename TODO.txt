1. Fix particles
    * Particles should not travel left over nothing (maybe when moving sideways, the thing underneath must not be the same type? But why does sand do it?)
2. Split Sandbox::update() into smaller functions
3. Replace fixed movement with velocity, mass, and acceleration
    * Two passes. First, each particle goes through and gets gravity applied to them, other forces from other particles, and extra movement to simulate liquids/sand/etc
    * Then, go through and move everything
4. More particle types
    * Quantum "portal" particles
    * Muti-particle structures
5. Better random noise
    * Sample a distribution to be faster, and look better


5. Figure out why line drawing sometimes leaves gaps
