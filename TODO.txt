1. More particle types
    * Make Plant look better and grow in a more interesting pattern (also add comments)
    * Gasses
    * Quantum "portal" particles
2. Resizing the window too small crashes

1. Save/Load simulations with files
2. Visualize axis lock controls and particle placement

1. Prettier rendering (Shaders, don't use the noise effect as much / better noise effect, heat haze blur?)
    * Shader based background (maybe similar to the effect I did in my roguelike, but more pixelated?)
2. Physics based movement
3. Liquid/Gas pressure (with rendering effects)
4. App icon and package
