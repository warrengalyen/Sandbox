1. More particle types
    * Make dead Life particles turn into blood somehow, and then that to iron
    * Pyrotheum fluid
    * Quantum "portal" particles
    * Gasses
2. Add some kind of background (cache noise from a few frames ago, and use that with a different scaling?)

1. Make Plant look better and grow in a more interesting pattern (also add comments)
2. Make particles move left/right randomly when they can do either
3. Resizing the window too small crashes
4. Fix Electricity getting stuck with 1 particle of water in mid-air
5. Make Electricity have a much lower noise when not in water
6. Make Electricity not die when it hits itself
7. Make Electricity die when it hits the last row

1. Animate Unstable explosion, maybe leave a particle/visual behind?
2. Visualize axis lock controls and particle placement
3. Save/Load simulations with files
4. GUI

1. Physics based movement
2. Liquid/Gas pressure (with rendering effects)
3. App icon and package
4. Wasm
