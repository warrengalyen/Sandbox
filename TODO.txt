1. More particle types
    * Make Plant look better and grow in a more interesting pattern (also add comments)
    * Gasses
    * Pyrotheum fluid
    * Quantum "portal" particles
    * Life particles that can be killed for blood, and then blood can be further processed
2. Resizing the window too small crashes
3. Fix Electricity getting stuck with 1 particle of water in mid-air
4. Make Electricity have a much lower noise when not in water
5. Make Electricity not die when it hits itself
6. Make Electricity die when it hits the last row
7. Add some kind of background (cache noise from a few frames ago, and use that with a different scaling?)
8. Animate Unstable explosion, maybe leave a particle/visual behind?

1. Save/Load simulations with files
2. Visualize axis lock controls and particle placement
3. GUI
4. Wasm

1. Physics based movement
2. Liquid/Gas pressure (with rendering effects)
3. App icon and package
