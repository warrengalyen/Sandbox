1. Fix particles
    * Acid/Water is still behaving weird (this can be fixed by not updating in reverse, but that has other tradeoffs)
    * Change to: First check which directions able to move in, then randomize left vs right

2. Replace fixed movement with velocity, mass, and acceleration
    * Three passes
    1. First, each particle goes through and gets gravity applied to them, other forces from other particles, and extra movement to simulate liquids/sand/etc
    2. Then, go through and move everything
    3. Apply interactions between touching particles
3. More particle types
    * WetSand - Formed by sand touching water, removes the water
    * Quantum "portal" particles
    * Muti-particle structures
    * Water pressure
4. Better random noise
    * Sample a distribution to be faster, and look better


5. Figure out why line drawing sometimes leaves gaps
6. Fix hidpi handling, deal with the black border
7. Deal with window resizes
